# Drawing Suggestions (html, css, javascript)
A simple page that helps you draw something with random suggestions

<b>How it works</b>

This page helps you draw something with random suggestion of the day, but if you are not comfortable, you can choose a theme, then it will give you a new suggestion.
Reload the page to have a new suggestion of the day or keep clicking the theme to change suggestion.

<b>How was it done</b>

HTML, CSS and Javascript

Developed by me (Marconip) and <a href="https://github.com/KalebeMatos">Kalebe Matos</a>

I designed and structure the codes<br/>
Kalebe Matos gave me a nice help in Javascript
